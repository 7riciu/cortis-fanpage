# cortis-fanpage

Hello 🧚🏻

I made this fanpage for Cortis.

It's my first time making a project in html, css, js outside of school and I tried to be creative with it 🤗

I experiemnted wuth different mechanics and added functionalities such as a drawing canvas, music players, pianos, image sliders, grids, etc.
