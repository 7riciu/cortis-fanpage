# cortis-fanpage

Hello 🧚🏻

I made this fanpage for Cortis.
It's my first personal project in html, css, and I tried to be creative with it 🤗

This projects includes 4 main sections: discography, members, merch and fun activities ^^ There are image sliders, song lyrics with translation buttons, music players, pianos, a memory match game, a "draw outside the lines" canvas and a fun layout overall 🌿
